**Are you a PM, Dev, or Designer? Do you want to use your software skills for civic activism?**

This app will make it easier for volunteers to phone bank for causes they care about.

Phone banking involves calling people to get them to go to the polls, show up at an event, or take some other action.

It also includes calling people in government or businesses to advocate for an issue.

This app will allow organizations to register, create projects that need phone banking, and upload call lists for those projects.

The app will expose an API that mobile apps (Android, iOS) can consume to get a list of current projects, get details on each project,
and get a call list and script for a specific project.

PMs, devs, and designers welcome. This is a volunteer project.

See the [android](https://github.com/chelseatroy/phonebankandroid) and [ios](https://github.com/chelseatroy/phonebankios) repos.
